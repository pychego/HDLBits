	You will create a small interactive console-based (i.e. text based) adventure game. The
project consists of 9 tasks. You are expected to use Visual Studio 2022 Community
Edition to build your game. You should complete the tasks in order, as some tasks
assume that previous tasks have been done. Each task builds upon the previous one.
Do as much as you can and then package your project for submission. Your solution
should demonstrate your knowledge of C++.
